# Reference Integration App (Read-Only)

`docs/reference/salla_integration/` contains a **read-only** copy of the legacy integration app
used during the Phase 2 migration. This folder is **never** installed, imported, or executed
by `salla_manager`.

Use the legacy code only to understand ERP creation/mapping behavior that will be re-implemented
in the future client executor app.
