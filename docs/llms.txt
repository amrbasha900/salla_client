## 📙 What you'll learn

- Add `fonts` folder under `assets`
- `webpack.config.js` Modification
- `master.twig` Modification 

<hr>

### assets folder in fonts

A new folder will be created within the assets folder and designated as "fonts."

<!-- focus: false -->
![IMAGE](https://cdn.salla.network/docs/twilight/4/custome-fonts-01.png)

### `webpack.config.js` Modification

Code addition to the webpack.config.js file will be implemented, in which the following code is placed on line `61` of the file to transfer the fonts folder from `assets` to `public` _(This is the case if the file has never been altered)_

```css title= "webpack.config.js " lineNumbers= True
new CopyPlugin({patterns: [{from: asset('fonts'), to: public('fonts')}]})
```

<br>

<!-- focus: false -->
![IMAGE](https://cdn.salla.network/docs/twilight/4/custome-fonts-02.png)

### `master.twig` Modification 

Insert the newly defined font into the `<head>` section of the `master.twig` file as follows:

```css title= "master.twig " lineNumbers= True

<style>@font-face {
  
  font-family: 'sallamenuthemeicons';
  src: url({{ 'fonts/themefonticons.ttf' | asset }}) format("truetype"),
  url({{ 'fonts/themefonticons.eot' | asset }}) format("embedded-opentype"),
  url({{'fonts/themefonticons.woff' | asset }}) format("woff");
}

</style>
```

We will now have established links between the new font files. It will continue to establish a link to the font's CSS file. In order to directly utilize the icon classes, we integrate it within the `app.css` file.
